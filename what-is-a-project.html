                <p>An Eagle Scout project is a significant service undertaken by a Scout to earn the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest rank in Scouts BSA.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>This project allows the scout to demonstrate leadership and planning by identifying a need within their community and developing a project to address it. The scope of the project requires the scout to organize, lead, and manage a team of volunteers to complete the work, which often includes tasks such as building structures, creating community gardens, or organizing events. </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>The project must benefit a school, community, or religious group other than the Scouts, BSA. It must demonstrate the Scoutâ€™s ability to plan, budget time and money, direct, and give leadership to others.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>In 2012, the National Eagle Scout Association researched the number of volunteer hours spent on Eagle Projects and it came a total of more than 100 million hours of service. Each year, new Eagle Scouts are adding more than three million more hours</p>
